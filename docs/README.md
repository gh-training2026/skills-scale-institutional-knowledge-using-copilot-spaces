# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

This repository centralizes OctoAcme's project management knowledge, converting team insights into structured, versioned artifacts. The README introduces OctoAcme’s processes and provides links to detailed guides.

OctoAcme's approach enables:
- Consistent, repeatable project execution
- Collaborative refinement of workflows and artifacts
- Equal access to processes, decisions, and rationale across the team
- Accelerated onboarding and reduced dependency risks
- Standardization through living documentation

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme manages projects through a structured lifecycle:
1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, align stakeholders, plan at a high level.
2. **Planning**: Break work into increments, identify dependencies/risks, estimate and prioritize backlog.
3. **Execution**: Delivery via sprints, tracking progress in project board, quality/testing, blocker escalation.
4. **Release & Deployment**: Standardized verification and release notes, rollback plans, stakeholder communication.
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings, action items, and measure improvements.

**Core Principles:**
- Customer-first decisions
- Iterative delivery with milestones
- Clear roles and responsibilities
- Data-informed choices and psychological safety
- Consistent documentation and feedback loops

Role coverage includes Project Managers, Product Managers, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders. Documentation supports onboarding, process improvement, and clarity.
